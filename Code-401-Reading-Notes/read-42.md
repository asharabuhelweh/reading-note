# Ethics in Technology

## ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

The Code as a whole is concerned with how fundamental ethical principles apply to a computing professional's conduct. The Code is not an algorithm for solving ethical problems; rather it serves as a basis for ethical decision-making.

6. Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences.
7. Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good.
8. Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure.

### PROFESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES

## The code I’m still ashamed of

In this article Bill Sourour told his story about code he wrote it once and still shamed of it until now
he started his story that he was miracle and start coding when he was 6 years old and by 21 he started work for drug company and he been asked to write a code for quiz to put in the website and  real purpose of the site was to push a particular drug. So, he chalked this tactic up to “marketing.” but it seems that no matter what I do, the quiz recommends the client’s drug as the best possible treatment. 
and after he did the code for the website,  a young girl who had taken the drug I’d built the website for.She had killed herself.
It’s easy to make an argument that he had no part in it at all. Still, he has never felt okay about writing that code.
at the end this story was a lesson for him to always try to think twice about the effects of his code before he write it.

so basically if he followed the Ethics in the workplace that could help him to avoid what happened
