# Data Modeling

## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

1. Increase the workflow efficiency and decrease the error
2. Ensure continuous integration and code flexibility and easier maintenance
3. Better program design and higher code quality
4. TDD reduces the time required for project development

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
beforeEach()/afterEach() automatically run before and after each tests, which  removes the explicit calls from the tests themselves, and invites inexperienced users to share state between tests.



## What is one downside of Test Driven Development

* The tests are dependent on external dependencies. ...
* The tests are hard to write because the code is more complex to write and understand.
* The development of the code is slow. ...
* The code of TDD is hard to understand as we know writing a code and writing a code well is different.

## Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance. ... A class constructor creates an instance of the class.

## Why REST?

One of the key advantages of REST APIs is that they provide a great deal of flexibility. Data is not tied to resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia. This flexibility allows developers to build an API that meets your needs while also meeting the needs of very diverse customers.

* Developers like REST because the learning curve is less steep.
* Web Services contract-first approach is more complex.
* The footprint of SOAP is too big for mobile, while the REST footprint is small and can be used very easily as it is based on HTTP protocol.
* Parsing of JSON is less compute and memory intensive than XML.

REST is much easier than other approaches such as SOAP which keeps developers from reinventing the wheel as far as HTTP request operations go. SOAP also requires separate server and client programs.

Since REST is based on standard HTTP operations, it uses verbs with specific meanings such as "get" or "delete," which avoids ambiguity. Resources are assigned individual URIs, adding flexibility.

With REST, information produced and consumed is separated from the technologies that facilitate production and consumption. As a result, REST performs well, is highly scalable, simple, and easy to modify and extend.

## Terms

* Functional programming: the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared states, mutable data, and side effects.
* Object-oriented programming (OOP): a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects
* Class: classes are the building blocks of OOP. A class is a collection of data and methods representing a particular object and allowing us to create as many of that object as we want consistently and functionally.
* super: is the class from which the subclass has been derived. It is mainly a keyword used to initialize the parent object from the child object
* this: it is a keyword used in OOB that refers to the same object we work on.
* Test Driven Development (TDD): it is a programming style that requires programmers to use unit tests for each functionality in the program. It ensures the quality and the integration of the program.
* Jest: it is a package that allows us to perform the unit test on Node code.
* Continuous Integration (CI): the process of maintaining code with tests and refactoring to allow the integration of the new code in the previous code and ensure the readiness of deployment.
* REST: stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a software architectural style that uses a subset of HTTP. It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services.
* Data Model: An abstract model that organizes data elements and standardizes how they relate to one another and the properties of real-world entities.
