## How to Solve Programming Problems

### Common mistakes
The most common mistake  when conducting interviews or watching someone try to solve a programming problem is **they try to start writing code as soon as possible.**

### A simple set of steps
1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

* **Read the problem completely twice:**
  
  You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times.If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it.  Do not worry about wasting time here, because the better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it.

 * **Solve the problem manually**
  
`“Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!”`

It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around. 

* **Optimize the manual solution**
  
  What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

* **Write pseudo-code or comments**
  
  By doing this, we can know exactly what the structure of the code we are going to write is going to look like which makes the job of filling in the actual code later trivial.

 * **Replace comments with real code**
  
  This step should be extremely easy at this point.  If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all.

  ***Any language you expect to be able to solve algorithm type problems in, you should know how to do the following things:***

  - Create a list
- Sort a list or array
- Create a map or dictionary
 - Loop through a list, or dictionary
- Parse strings
- Convert from string to int, int to string, etc

## Pretend Your Time is Worth $1,000/Hour 

`“Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?”` -Niklas Göke


The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth.
- many people waste much of their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don’t help them reach their true goals — their mission.
The truth is, most people value their time at far, far less than it’s worth.

**But what if you placed a high value on your time?**
Your results would be incredible. You’d become exponentially more productive, focused, and effective.

### Busyness and Stress Are the Enemy
`“Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy. If you’re chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something wrong. Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus. Then when you’re done be done, and go enjoy the rest of your day.”`


*`“The most successful people I know are not busy. They’re focused.”`*

“The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.” -Warren Buffet


## How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving
“Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs

- **Problem solving is the meta-skill.**
   - try a solution.
   - If that doesn’t work, try another one.
   - If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.


`“The biggest mistake I see new programmers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems.”` — V. Anton Spraul

 what should you do when you encounter a new problem?
 1. **Understand:**
Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).

2. **Plan:**
Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

3. **Divide:** Do not try to solve one big problem. Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
   
4. Stuck?
   
   - Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
   - Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
  
   - Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).



## 5 Whys Technique
when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.

When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis? You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems

***How to Use the 5 Whys***

  1. Assemble a Team
2. Define the Problem
3. Ask the First "Why?"
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
5. Know When to Stop
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor Your Measures
