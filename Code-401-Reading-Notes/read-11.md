# Event Driven Applications

## Why is access control important?

The ultimate aim of access control is to provide a level of security that minimises risk to a business or organisation by helping to keep buildings, data and people secure. This is why access control goes hand in hand with I.T security and should be a key consideration for every business owner. Without proper access control you could leave your staff and your company wide open to problems such as data loss, theft or breach of privacy and data protection laws.

## Describe an application that would need access control

Applications like accounting software need access control because many types of users are dealing with the application. Normal users would only be allowed to modify their personal information and read receipts or have a copy of them. Employees would have access to modify users' sensitive information and produce receipts, add new users to the system. Admin will have access to employees' data, change any kind of information they need, delete users, add new shops, etc.

## What is a role used for?

A role is a keyword that determines the level of accessibility of each user. So, some users are just normal users, and others are admins or employees. So, each one of the users should have in their information this keyword which is the role.

## Why is role-based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

Role-Based Access Control takes more of a real-world approach to structuring access control. Access under RBAC is based on a user's job function within the organization to which the computer system belongs.

Essentially, RBAC assigns permissions to particular roles in an organization. Users are then assigned to that particular role. For example, an accountant in a company will be assigned to the Accountant role, gaining access to all the resources permitted for all accountants on the system. Similarly, a software engineer might be assigned to the developer role.

Roles differ from groups in that while users may belong to multiple groups, a user under RBAC may only be assigned a single role in an organization. Additionally, there is no way to provide individual users additional permissions over and above those available for their role. The accountant described above gets the same permissions as all other accountants, nothing more and nothing less.

## Term

1. Authorization: Authorization is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources, including files, services, computer programs, data, and application features.
2. Role-Based Access Control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security paradigm whereby users are granted access to resources based on their role in the company. RBAC, if implemented correctly, can be an effective way of enforcing the principle of least privilege.
3. Capabilities: it is a function that determines each role and its privileges according to the role keyword provided to the user object in software.
